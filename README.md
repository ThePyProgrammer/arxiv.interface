Made for Assignment 1 of CS6131. (By Prannaya Gupta, M23604)

This is effectively a moderately functional version of a proper research project database. It's still not using an actual DBMS just yet but I'm done with a lot of planned features. Stack used is Vue.js, under CDN, hence you can open the app via just clicking on the `index.html` file.

In other news, you can access the website at http://interface.prannay.ml/#/ (as it is hosted there) but GitHub's deployment services have been glitching quite a bit over the past few days, hence I'd suggest not using that. Future work would entail using Firebase Hosting to host instead.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused by this. Thank you Mrs Lee.
